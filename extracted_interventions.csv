NCT01306032,73958486,ABT-888,PARP enzymes are critical for maintaining genomic stability by regulating a variety of DNA repair mechanisms. Individuals with deleterious mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 tumor suppressor genes have an increased risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers due to impaired or defective DNA damage repair; these individuals have an increased susceptibility to DNA-damaging agents and PARP inhibitors. Inhibition of PARP inhibits the repair of DNA damage caused by alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide. Metronomic cyclophosphamide has demonstrated efficacy in several tumor types. The PARP inhibitor ABT-888 has been shown to potentiate the action of cyclophosphamide in xenograft models. This combination is well tolerated in a Phase I study and showing promising activity.,BRCA-positive Ovarian Cancer: ABT-888 + Cyclophosphamide
